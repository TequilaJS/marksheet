I"¦<p>While HTML is about defining the <em>content</em> of a webpage, CSS is about <strong>styling</strong> a webpage. It means setting colors, fonts, dimensions, margins, positions, of a webpageâ€™s <strong>elements</strong>.</p>

<p>HTML is inert. CSS is fluid.</p>

<p>CSS brings a webpage to life, by applying a coat of paint on its static content, and elevates its purpose through color, space, emphasis and motion.</p>
