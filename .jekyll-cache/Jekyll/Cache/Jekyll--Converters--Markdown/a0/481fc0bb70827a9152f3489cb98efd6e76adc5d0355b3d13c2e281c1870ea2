I"¸<p>Youâ€™re certainly already acquainted with document editors, like <strong>Microsoft <strong>Word</strong></strong>, with which you can <strong>structure</strong> your document with titles, paragraph, lists, tables, images, <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong> provides roughly the same elements of formatting. The key difference is that formatting text in Microsoft Word is <em>visual</em>, whereas HTML code is purely <strong>semantic</strong>: you provide <em>meaning</em> to your text.</p>

<p>The same way you use â™« <strong>notes</strong> â™¬ to write <strong>music</strong>, you use <strong>HTML</strong> to write <strong>webpages</strong>.</p>
